If you asked people to identify a lived experience that typified the climate crisis for them,
many would nominate a day of record breaking heat in their city/town.
If you live in Seattle, for instance, there's a good chance you'd nominate 28 June 2021,
when the daily maximum temperature at Seattle-Tacoma airport was 108F,
a whopping 5F higher than the previous record.

When daily heat records get broken by a wide margin like they did during the Pacific northwest heatwave,
it inevitably prompts a range of questions relating to the climate crisis.
Should we expect heat like this all the time now?
Do these crazy high temperatures mean climate change is advancing faster than we expected
(e.g. [here](https://grist.org/science/is-climate-change-happening-faster-than-expected-a-climate-scientist-explains/)
and [here](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/do-these-heat-waves-mean-climate-change-happening-faster-expected))?
Conversely, what are we to make of weather station records that have remained unbroken for many decades?
Do they mean climate change isn't too much of a concern?

A complicated reality of the climate crisis is that the very thing most intuitively linked
to rising greenhouse gas concentrations – experiencing a day of record shattering heat – is the hardest
to disentangle from random weather variability.
It’s a classic small sample problem.
Our observational records are relatively short (100 years or so in most places) and
extreme heat at a particular location (like the Seattle-Tacoma area) is very rare
because the weather patterns that produce it don't come around very often.

Over larger areas and/or longer time periods,
variability isn't as large and records are being broken all the time - the global annual mean temperature record
has been broken over and over again in recent decades.
In fact, even at the scale of daily temperatures measured at individual weather stations,
we're seeing increasingly more hot records than cold [find reference].
The odds of breaking daily maximum temperature records are shortening everywhere,
but if rising greenhouse gases cause those odds to go from a 1 in 5000 year chance to a 1 in 500 year chance,
those are still pretty long odds.

To try and understand just how bad the small sample problem is for daily temperature records,
we used a climate model to simulate 45,000 years of daily weather over the Pacific northwest
([Risbey et al 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/acd714)).
We then went through a process of picking out a thousand random samples of 100 years from the population of 45,000,
then a thousand samples of 1000 years, 2000 years, 5000 years and so on.
For each sample we recorded the maximum daily temperature we found.
To our surprise, as the samples got bigger and bigger the maximum temperatures we found showed little evidence of stablising.
They just continued to grow, indicating that even sample sizes spanning tens of thousands of years are insufficient.

Our results demonstrate quite clearly that reliably estimating the likelihood (or return period) of record shattering extremes
is the mother of all small sample problems (at least when it comes to mid-latitude locations like Seattle-Tacoma).
We shouldn’t necessarily assume that climate change is happening faster than projected
if a new record temperature wasn’t “expected” for many decades to come.
That's certainly a possibility,
but it's also possible that we would have expected those temperatures had we run our projection models thousands more times.
It also shouldn't surprise us that record shattering events (i.e. those that break the previous record by a wide margin)
can persist in the record books for a very long time.
For instance, many of the daily temperature records set across the American and Canadian prairies
during the dust bowl era of the 1930s are still unbroken today.
The persistence of those records in spite of the strong global warming we've experienced in the decades since
is a testament to just how variable local weather can be.
